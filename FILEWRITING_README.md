# Writing Player Actions to File System:
 
 As the game is played, the actions committed by the player are stored to a file in Application.persistentDataPath. The file is a text file where every line is an individual action, and information regarding the elements is space separated. Currently, it will record the player’s current session number, the time the action occurred, and what type of action it was, including player login, mouse clicks, keyboard key presses, keyboard key releases, button presses, scene changes, shape rotations, and challenge submissions.

## Line Format:

#### SessionNumber Year Month Day Hour Minute Second Millisecond ActionType …ActionDetails…

#### Click mouseLocationX mouseLocationY mouseLocationZ
   
mouseLocationX: X coordinate of the mouse 

mouseLocationY: Y coordinate of the mouse

mouseLocationZ: Z coordinate of the mouse

Whenever the user clicks, records the location of the mouse.

&nbsp;

### Scene Change

#### SceneChange oldSceneName newSceneName

success: whether the user answered correctly or not, True or False 

currentChallengeNum: the current question number that the user is on 

totalChallenges: the total number of questions for the user in this set

Whenever the user submits an answer to a challenge question it records this information.

objectName: the name of the object being rotated

pastX: the previous Euler X rotation value before the rotation 

pastY: the previous Euler Y rotation value before the rotation 

pastZ: the previous Euler Z rotation value before the rotation 

newX: the current Euler X rotation value after the rotation 

newY: the current Euler Y rotation value after the rotation
