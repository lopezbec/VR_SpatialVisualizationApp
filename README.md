# SpatialVisualizationApp
 

This application is designed to help users practice their spatial visualization skills with several different modules.
The first module is based on the concept of 2D projection, making a flat drawing out of a 3D object based on some perspective.
To see some examples of the practice modules for that idea, try the links below.
